In literature and poetry, the word Almas is often used metaphorically to describe something of great value or purity. Much like a diamond formed under pressure, the name reflects endurance and the ability to shine even in challenging situations. For families, naming their child Almas can signify a wish for their child to grow into someone admirable, strong, and cherished.
